# Changelog

## v1.0.0

### Frontend surface completeness (hanzo.app + hanzo.chat)

- Added the `app` service spec (`app/openapi.yaml`): the hanzo.app projects &
  deployments surface at top-level `/v1/projects/*` — `GET/POST /v1/projects`,
  `GET/PATCH/DELETE /v1/projects/{slug}`, `POST /v1/projects/{slug}/deploy`
  (tar artifact or git build), `GET /v1/projects/{slug}/deployments`.
- Added the `base` service spec (`base/openapi.yaml`): the Hanzo Base records
  store at top-level `/v1/collections/{collection}/records[/{id}]` (CRUD),
  backing hanzo.app's `site_drafts` working-draft store.
- `ai` spec: defined the image and audio operations its own description already
  advertised — `POST /v1/images/generations`, `POST /v1/audio/speech`,
  `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` (OpenAI-compatible).
- Confirmed zero `/api/` paths across every spec; the only non-`/v1` routes are
  the unversioned infra probes `/health`, `/healthz`, `/metrics`.
- `hanzo.yaml` regenerated: 38 services, 1590 paths.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-06-30

### AI inference namespace

- Added the `ai` service spec (`ai/openapi.yaml`): the top-level OpenAI- and
  Claude-compatible inference surface served by `hanzoai/ai` — `/v1/chat/completions`,
  `/v1/completions`, `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/rerank`, `/v1/models`, `/v1/models/{model}`,
  `/v1/messages` (Anthropic). These are the ONE deliberate exception to the
  `/v1/<service>/` rule (SDK path-compatibility is the contract).
- Un-nested inference from the cloud control plane: removed
  `/v1/cloud/chat/completions` (moved to top-level `ai`). `/v1/cloud/*` is now the
  user-org control plane only.
- `hanzo.yaml` discovery now lists `ai` (gateway_route `/v1/chat/completions`) and
  corrects `cloud` to `/v1/cloud`.

## v1.0.0 — 2026-05-31

Forward-only v1 lock-in. No prior versions, no backwards compatibility.

### Scope

All 34 service specifications plus the master discovery spec
(`hanzo.yaml`) are now at `info.version: 1.0.0`.

### Routing

- Every route is `/v1/<service>/<resource>`. The same path resolves through
  the gateway at `api.hanzo.ai` and through the service's own hostname.
- `/api/` prefixes are removed from every spec (794 routes rewritten).
- IAM also exposes `/oauth/*` (RFC 6749 / OIDC) and `/.well-known/*`
  (RFC 5785) at the root.

### IAM

- 227 legacy Casdoor RPC-style `/api/<verb>-<resource>` routes rewritten to
  REST under `/v1/iam/<resource>[/{id}]`. Verb is encoded in the HTTP method.
- 233 input paths consolidated to 150 REST paths after collision merging.
- OIDC and OAuth2 endpoints (`/oauth/token`, `/oauth/authorize`,
  `/oauth/userinfo`, `/oauth/introspect`, `/oauth/callback`) moved to
  canonical paths per RFC 6749.

### Security

- Every operation uses `BearerAuth` (JWT issued by Hanzo IAM at
  `https://hanzo.id`).
- Bearer scheme cites the OIDC discovery URL
  (`https://hanzo.id/.well-known/openid-configuration`).
- No service has its own login flow.

### Cleanup

- 1 `deprecated: true` operation removed (console).
- 1 cross-brand DID method reference removed from the did spec; only the `did:hanzo` method is supported.
- Loki upstream paths (`/loki/api/v1/*`) renamed to `/v1/o11y/logs/*` for
  consistency.
- chat had two competing `bearerAuth` / `BearerAuth` security schemes;
  consolidated to `BearerAuth` only.
- Master `hanzo.yaml` rewritten as a thin v1 discovery index. The previous
  1202-line union-of-services dump is replaced by a 3-route document
  (`/v1/discovery`, `/v1/health`, `/.well-known/openid-configuration`)
  plus a `Service` schema. Per-service detail lives in each service's own
  spec; there is no cross-file `$ref`.

### 2026-06-30 — cloud product surface documented at /v1

- Added the previously-undocumented cloud product/docs-RAG surface to
  `cloud/openapi.yaml`, top-level per the lock-in (no `/api/`): `/v1/search-docs`,
  `/v1/search-docs/indexes`, `/v1/search-docs/stats`, `/v1/chat-docs`,
  `/v1/index-docs`, `/v1/vector/collections`, `/v1/vector/stats`. These are the
  console Search/Vector panels + docs-RAG clients (python-sdk, hanzo-docs). The
  routes served the residual `/api/<route>` form and were renamed to `/v1/<route>`
  in hanzoai/cloud (productsvc) + hanzoai/ai; the spec now matches. New tag:
  `Search API`. Whole-repo `/api/` sweep confirms zero remaining Hanzo paths.
